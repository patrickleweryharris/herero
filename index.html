<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Germany committed terrible crimes during the
Second World War. This is not in doubt. However, in the years immediately after
the end of the war, there was much debate, both inside West Germany and in the
West, as to who exactly committed these crimes. There was a trend to attribute
the crime to <em>Nazis</em> and term Germans as victims. Specifically, there was
a concerted effort by the Post War West German government and people as a whole
to attribute all crimes of Hitler&rsquo;s regime to the <em>Schutzstaffel</em>
(SS) and the <em>Nazis, </em>leaving the German armed forces (the
<em>Wehrmacht</em>) innocent of any crimes. This trend eventually became known
as the myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; or &lsquo;Clean&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht.
</em> This is of course completely false. The <em>Wehrmacht </em>was a willing
and constant participant in German war crimes.<sup id="fnref:1"> <a href="#fn:1"

<sup id="fnref:2"> <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup>
 <sup id="fnref:3"> <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup> </span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the evidence against it, the myth was a constant presence in post war West Germany.
  The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em> was a changing political issue over time. First it was the
  mechanism of establishing Germany in the world. Later it would become another part of Germany&rsquo;s national shame.
  The myth was used by the governments of Konrad Adenauer and his successors to establish the place of West Germany in the
  world, that being a willing, independent and equal ally against Soviet aggression. The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo;
  <em>Wehrmacht</em> gave West Germany a place to build off of. Later governments would also attempt to use the myth to
  further their own political aims, but would soon realize that the myth had become a controversy for a new generation.
  To examine this changing political issue, two specific case studies will be presented. The first comes from the early
   years of West Germany, and follows the establishment of the West German army in the early 1950s, and the domestic and
   international ramifications. The second is the tale of the Bitburg controversy, which helps to expose how the myth of
   the &lsquo;Good&rsquo;
  <em>Wehrmacht </em>became a sensitive issue to German national pride and identity regarding the recent past.</p>

  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Myth of the
 &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em> was not isolated inside of Germany. As
 much as the myth was used as a tool to rebuild German national identity
 following the catastrophe of the Second World War, the myth was also used to
 great effect in the matter of foreign policy. The myth helped to facilitate West
 German rearmament and the newfound place for West Germany in the North Atlantic
 Treaty Organization (NATO). Initially, Germany was punished after the war.
 Thousands of officials and soldiers of the old regime were interned, and a
 campaign of denazification was begun<sup id="fnref:4"> <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup>
 </span><span class="s1">. However, within a
 few years, West Germany was essential to the NATO strategy to defend against a
 possible Soviet attack along the Iron Curtain. Due to this, &ldquo;the once
 vigorous denazification campaign stopped and a joint American/German production
 of remembering commenced that fostered a myth of the German Wehrmacht and its
 behaviour in WWII&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:5"> <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The rehabilitation of the
 <em>Wehrmacht </em>and the rise of the myth was a direct precondition of West
 German rearmament after the war. This was specified by the Himmerode Memorandum
 of 1950. This report was compiled by a group of former <em>Wehrmacht
 </em>officers called into conference by Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of
 West Germany<sup id="fnref:6"> <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span class="s1">. These officers viewed that &ldquo;a German
 army could be called into existence only after representatives of the Western
 powers had issued a formal declaration rehabilitating the soldiers of the
 Wehrmacht&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:7"> <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. These officers were of course acting
 in their own self interest, among their number they included Hermann Foertsch,
 who was &ldquo;one of the leaders responsible for indoctrinating the troops with
 National Socialist ideas&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:8"> <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. Others present at the
 Himmerode Conference would go on to posts of power in the <em>Bundeswehr</em>
 (the new West German army), such as Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger. This
 underscores the simple fact of West German rearmament. On one hand the modern
 <em>Bundeswehr </em>does not view itself as a successor agency to the
 <em>Wehrmacht </em>or the earlier <em>Reichswehr</em> (the army of the Weimar
 Republic), and makes stringent efforts to distance itself from the crimes of the
 past<sup id="fnref:9"> <a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span class="s1">. On the other hand there is the issue that the new
 <em>Bundeswehr</em> needed an experienced officer corps to be able to stand up
 to any Soviet aggression. Of course, these officers would have to be drawn from
 the cadre of former <em>Wehrmacht </em>officers.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">A political problem now
 arose. Adenauer&rsquo;s government could not in any respect be seen as publicly
 accepting former <em>Nazi </em>officers, one time persecutors, into a military
 that&rsquo;s entire mission was the defence of the German people<sup id="fnref:10"> <a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span
 class="s1">. A solution was quickly found in separating the terms <em>Nazi
 </em>and <em>Wehrmacht. </em>This was done by persuading American supreme
 commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to retract earlier comments where he
 &ldquo;identified it [the <em>Wehrmacht</em>] with National
 Socialism&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:11"> <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. He would later tell domestic German
 reporters that &ldquo;a real difference existed between German soldiers and
 officers as such and Hitler and his criminal gang&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:12"> <a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span
 class="s1">. Adenauer would also make statements in the <em>Bundestag</em> (West
 German parliament) which &ldquo;officially restored the honour of those soldiers
 &lsquo;who had not been guilty of any offence&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:13"> <a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span
 class="s1">. Thus a distinction had been drawn between the <em>Nazi
 </em>criminals and the soldiers of the <em>Wehrmacht</em>. These statements, and
 accompanying legislation in the West German Basic Law<sup id="fnref:14"> <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span class="s1">
 allowed for former <em>Wehrmacht </em>officers and soldiers to reclaim pensions
 and positions previously lost to denazification efforts. This was not it&rsquo;s
 greatest possible effect though. The head of the West German government and the
 most powerful officer of the Allied powers had explicitly endorsed the myth of
 the &lsquo;good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht, </em>providing the myth with a powerful
 legitimatizing force in West Germany.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The myth did not only need to be legitimatized
 inside of Germany though. The Western Allied powers, who barely ten years before
 had been hellbent on the destruction of the entire German regime, <em>Wehrmacht
 </em>included, now needed to provide reasoning as to why former <em>Nazi
 </em>officers were being put into positions of power again. The myth of the
 &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht </em>was spread around the Allied powers and
 enshrined in propaganda. A principal example of this was a picture book printed
 in 1950, called <em>Life&rsquo;s Picture History</em></span><sup id="fnref:15"> <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span
 class="s1"><em>. </em>The book principally gave the American&rsquo;s more credit
 for ending the war in Europe than the Soviets</span><sup id="fnref:16"> <a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">, and made
 very little mention of the &ldquo;war of extermination on the Eastern
 Front&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:17"> <a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. It also made light of atrocities committed
 by the Germans, attributing them to &ldquo;<em>Nazis</em> and not German solders
 per se&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:18"> <a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The book would go on to describe the
 victims of German atrocities as people &ldquo;Hitler didn&rsquo;t
 like&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:19"> <a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The terminology here is extremely
 important. Not only did the book refuse to identify any crimes as being
 committed by the Germans, but it also placed the blame squarely, and only, at
 Hitler&rsquo;s feet</span><sup id="fnref:20"> <a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The book created the message it
 wished to send, that the crimes of the Nazis were not the crimes of the Germans,
 through omission. By omitting any mention of the <em>Wehrmacht</em>, the
 <em>Wehrmacht </em>could not be implicated in any crimes, and was thus innocent.
 This book, thoroughly popular in the United States</span><sup id="fnref:21"> <a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">,
 would help &ldquo;foster the myth of the &lsquo;Clean&rsquo;
 [&lsquo;Good&rsquo;] <em>Wehrmacht</em> in American popular
 memory&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:22"> <a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="p2">&nbsp;
</p>
 <p class="p3"><span class="s1">This shift of terminology away from
 German crimes and towards <em>Nazi</em> crimes had an explicit political
 purpose. In American Cold War planning, &ldquo;West Germans became indispensable
 allies and the front-line troops in the most dangerous war
 ever&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:23"> <a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. For the Americans to explicitly condemn the
 prior actions of the very soldiers that it relied on was a political
 impossibility. No German would fight for the new world order led by the United
 States if the United States simultaneously condemned their entire nation as a
 nation of criminals. Therefore the United States was forced to accept, whether
 willingly or unwillingly, the shift of blame from <em>Wehrmacht </em>to
 <em>Nazi</em> as a result of the political climate of the time. In trying to
 present a united front for NATO against Soviet aggression, the United States was
 forced to forget about animosities of the past and prepare for the future. The
 Cold War, while never heating up, still made stra
 nge
 bedfellows.&nbsp;</span> The myth of the 'Good'</p>
