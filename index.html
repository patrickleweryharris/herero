<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Germany committed terrible crimes during the
Second World War. This is not in doubt. However, in the years immediately after
the end of the war, there was much debate, both inside West Germany and in the
West, as to who exactly committed these crimes. There was a trend to attribute
the crime to <em>Nazis</em> and term Germans as victims. Specifically, there was
a concerted effort by the Post War West German government and people as a whole
to attribute all crimes of Hitler&rsquo;s regime to the <em>Schutzstaffel</em>
(SS) and the <em>Nazis, </em>leaving the German armed forces (the
<em>Wehrmacht</em>) innocent of any crimes. This trend eventually became known
as the myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; or &lsquo;Clean&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht.
</em> This is of course completely false. The <em>Wehrmacht </em>was a willing
and constant participant in German war crimes.<sup id="fnref:1"> <a href="#fn:1"

<sup id="fnref:2"> <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup>
 <sup id="fnref:3"> <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup> </span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the evidence against it, the myth was a constant presence in post war West Germany.
  The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em> was a changing political issue over time. First it was the
  mechanism of establishing Germany in the world. Later it would become another part of Germany&rsquo;s national shame.
  The myth was used by the governments of Konrad Adenauer and his successors to establish the place of West Germany in the
  world, that being a willing, independent and equal ally against Soviet aggression. The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo;
  <em>Wehrmacht</em> gave West Germany a place to build off of. Later governments would also attempt to use the myth to
  further their own political aims, but would soon realize that the myth had become a controversy for a new generation.
  To examine this changing political issue, two specific case studies will be presented. The first comes from the early
   years of West Germany, and follows the establishment of the West German army in the early 1950s, and the domestic and
   international ramifications. The second is the tale of the Bitburg controversy, which helps to expose how the myth of
   the &lsquo;Good&rsquo;
  <em>Wehrmacht </em>became a sensitive issue to German national pride and identity regarding the recent past.</p>

  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Myth of the
 &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em> was not isolated inside of Germany. As
 much as the myth was used as a tool to rebuild German national identity
 following the catastrophe of the Second World War, the myth was also used to
 great effect in the matter of foreign policy. The myth helped to facilitate West
 German rearmament and the newfound place for West Germany in the North Atlantic
 Treaty Organization (NATO). Initially, Germany was punished after the war.
 Thousands of officials and soldiers of the old regime were interned, and a
 campaign of denazification was begun<sup id="fnref:4"> <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup>
 </span><span class="s1">. However, within a
 few years, West Germany was essential to the NATO strategy to defend against a
 possible Soviet attack along the Iron Curtain. Due to this, &ldquo;the once
 vigorous denazification campaign stopped and a joint American/German production
 of remembering commenced that fostered a myth of the German Wehrmacht and its
 behaviour in WWII&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:5"> <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The rehabilitation of the
 <em>Wehrmacht </em>and the rise of the myth was a direct precondition of West
 German rearmament after the war. This was specified by the Himmerode Memorandum
 of 1950. This report was compiled by a group of former <em>Wehrmacht
 </em>officers called into conference by Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of
 West Germany<sup id="fnref:6"> <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span class="s1">. These officers viewed that &ldquo;a German
 army could be called into existence only after representatives of the Western
 powers had issued a formal declaration rehabilitating the soldiers of the
 Wehrmacht&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:7"> <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. These officers were of course acting
 in their own self interest, among their number they included Hermann Foertsch,
 who was &ldquo;one of the leaders responsible for indoctrinating the troops with
 National Socialist ideas&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:8"> <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. Others present at the
 Himmerode Conference would go on to posts of power in the <em>Bundeswehr</em>
 (the new West German army), such as Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger. This
 underscores the simple fact of West German rearmament. On one hand the modern
 <em>Bundeswehr </em>does not view itself as a successor agency to the
 <em>Wehrmacht </em>or the earlier <em>Reichswehr</em> (the army of the Weimar
 Republic), and makes stringent efforts to distance itself from the crimes of the
 past<sup id="fnref:9"> <a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span class="s1">. On the other hand there is the issue that the new
 <em>Bundeswehr</em> needed an experienced officer corps to be able to stand up
 to any Soviet aggression. Of course, these officers would have to be drawn from
 the cadre of former <em>Wehrmacht </em>officers.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">A political problem now
 arose. Adenauer&rsquo;s government could not in any respect be seen as publicly
 accepting former <em>Nazi </em>officers, one time persecutors, into a military
 that&rsquo;s entire mission was the defence of the German people<sup id="fnref:10"> <a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span
 class="s1">. A solution was quickly found in separating the terms <em>Nazi
 </em>and <em>Wehrmacht. </em>This was done by persuading American supreme
 commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to retract earlier comments where he
 &ldquo;identified it [the <em>Wehrmacht</em>] with National
 Socialism&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:11"> <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. He would later tell domestic German
 reporters that &ldquo;a real difference existed between German soldiers and
 officers as such and Hitler and his criminal gang&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:12"> <a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span
 class="s1">. Adenauer would also make statements in the <em>Bundestag</em> (West
 German parliament) which &ldquo;officially restored the honour of those soldiers
 &lsquo;who had not been guilty of any offence&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:13"> <a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span
 class="s1">. Thus a distinction had been drawn between the <em>Nazi
 </em>criminals and the soldiers of the <em>Wehrmacht</em>. These statements, and
 accompanying legislation in the West German Basic Law<sup id="fnref:14"> <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup></span><span class="s1">
 allowed for former <em>Wehrmacht </em>officers and soldiers to reclaim pensions
 and positions previously lost to denazification efforts. This was not it&rsquo;s
 greatest possible effect though. The head of the West German government and the
 most powerful officer of the Allied powers had explicitly endorsed the myth of
 the &lsquo;good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht, </em>providing the myth with a powerful
 legitimatizing force in West Germany.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The myth did not only need to be legitimatized
 inside of Germany though. The Western Allied powers, who barely ten years before
 had been hellbent on the destruction of the entire German regime, <em>Wehrmacht
 </em>included, now needed to provide reasoning as to why former <em>Nazi
 </em>officers were being put into positions of power again. The myth of the
 &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht </em>was spread around the Allied powers and
 enshrined in propaganda.  Daniel Clayton covers this extensively in his paper <em>They Were Soldiers Just Like Us.</em> A principal example which Clayton uses was a picture book printed in 1950, called <em>Life&rsquo;s Picture History</em></span><sup id="fnref:15"> <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span
 class="s1"><em>. </em>The book principally gave the American&rsquo;s more credit
 for ending the war in Europe than the Soviets</span><sup id="fnref:16"> <a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">, and made
 very little mention of the &ldquo;war of extermination on the Eastern
 Front&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:17"> <a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. It also made light of atrocities committed
 by the Germans, attributing them to &ldquo;<em>Nazis</em> and not German solders
 per se&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:18"> <a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The book would go on to describe the
 victims of German atrocities as people &ldquo;Hitler didn&rsquo;t
 like&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:19"> <a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The terminology here is extremely
 important. Not only did the book refuse to identify any crimes as being
 committed by the Germans, but it also placed the blame squarely, and only, at
 Hitler&rsquo;s feet</span><sup id="fnref:20"> <a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. The book created the message it
 wished to send, that the crimes of the Nazis were not the crimes of the Germans,
 through omission. By omitting any mention of the <em>Wehrmacht</em>, the
 <em>Wehrmacht </em>could not be implicated in any crimes, and was thus innocent.
 This book, thoroughly popular in the United States</span><sup id="fnref:21"> <a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">,
 would help &ldquo;foster the myth of the &lsquo;Clean&rsquo;
 [&lsquo;Good&rsquo;] <em>Wehrmacht</em> in American popular
 memory&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:22"> <a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="p2">&nbsp;
</p>
 <p class="p3"><span class="s1">This shift of terminology away from
 German crimes and towards <em>Nazi</em> crimes had an explicit political
 purpose. In American Cold War planning, &ldquo;West Germans became indispensable
 allies and the front-line troops in the most dangerous war
 ever&rdquo;</span><sup id="fnref:23"> <a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup><span class="s1">. For the Americans to explicitly condemn the
 prior actions of the very soldiers that it relied on was a political
 impossibility. No German would fight for the new world order led by the United
 States if the United States simultaneously condemned their entire nation as a
 nation of criminals. Therefore the United States was forced to accept, whether
 willingly or unwillingly, the shift of blame from <em>Wehrmacht </em>to
 <em>Nazi</em> as a result of the political climate of the time. In trying to
 present a united front for NATO against Soviet aggression, the United States was
 forced to forget about animosities of the past and prepare for the future. The
 Cold War, while never heating up, still made strange
 bedfellows.&nbsp;</span> </p>

         <p> Take note of the bias of this video. Even as it addressed the controversy surronding Reagan's visit,
           the announcer squarley places all the blame at the feet of the <em>SS</em>, and the only problem the Americans have is with the <em>SS</em>.

           But pay attention to Reagan's words. At 4:03, he introduces a concept that German and American veterans are "like brothers", once again belittling the role of the <em>Wehrmacht</em> in the crimes of the Second World War.
         </p>
       </div>
       <div class="col-md-8"> <div class="crimes-text">
         <p>The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht </em>did not die in
           the era of Adenauer. In the 1980&rsquo;s, the myth would become the centre
           of a complex political argument regarding West Germany&rsquo;s place in the world.
           This argument came to light during American President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s
           visit to Germany in 1985. Reagan, and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
           visited Bergen Belsen concentration camp and a military cemetery near
           the town of Bitburg<sup id="fnref:24"> <a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">24</a> </sup>. Kohl would stated during the visit to the cemetery
           that &ldquo;Bitburg can be regarded as a symbol of reconciliation and of
           German - American friendship&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:25"> <a href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">25</a> </sup>, while Reagan &ldquo;remembered the
           German soldiers as victims, too, of Hitler&rsquo;s regime&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:26"> <a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">26</a> </sup>.
           It appears to Hannah Holtschneider, the author of <em>German
             Protestants Remember the Holocaust, </em>that this visit with
             Reagan was meant to evoke similar sentiments that Kohl&rsquo;s
             visit with French President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand at Verdun
             earlier in 1984<sup id="fnref:27"> <a href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">27</a> </sup>. Kohl and Mitterrand had &ldquo;held hands in
             silence&rdquo;, and were &ldquo;intending symbolically to show
             their mutual respect and readiness to forgive past wrongs&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:28"> <a href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">28</a> </sup>.
             In Holtschneider&rsquo;s view, if there had been a similar positive
             reaction to the Bitburg visit as there had been to this, Kohl would
             have fulfilled &ldquo;his ambition to draw a line under Germany&rsquo;s
             NS [National Socialist] past and to establish West Germany as a fully
             recognized and trusted member of the Western Alliance&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:29"> <a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">29</a> </sup>.
             This supposed plan backfired unfortunately. Unbeknownst to Kohl,
             the cemetery at Bitburg contained the graves of <em>Waffen-SS</em>
             troops<sup id="fnref:30"> <a href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">30</a> </sup>. This event was highly criticized, but the political fallout
              was contained by West German President Richard von Weizs&auml;cker&rsquo;s
              speech on the fortieth anniversary of Germany&rsquo;s surrender on May 8, 1945<sup id="fnref:31"> <a href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">32</a> </sup>..
              It has been posited by Micheal Prince in <em>War and German Memory</em>
              that Bitburg had a far greater effect than the political scandal for Kohl&rsquo;s government.
              Prince asserted that &ldquo;honouring German soldiers at such a place as Bitburg symbolically
              equated the war dead of both sides, despite the fact that the two had fought for diametrically
              opposing causes and principles&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:32"> <a href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">32</a> </sup>.. In Prince&rsquo;s view, &ldquo;Germany sought to undercut
              the judgements of existing cultural memory and replace them with a softer, more palatable and
              palliative narrative in which all suffering is alike and all dead equal victims of war&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:33"> <a href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">33</a> </sup>.. </p>

              <p> Just as the government of Konrad Adenauer had tried to brand
                German war crimes as crimes of the <em>Nazis </em>and Hitler,
                Kohl can be seen as trying to do the same thing. He came at it
                from a different angle. He did not directly attempt to exonerate
                all Germans through pinning their crimes upon the actions of a
                fanatical few. Rather he sought to paint all Germans, which of
                course included the ordinary men of the<em>Wehrmacht</em>, as
                victims of the <em>Nazis. </em>This was in effect an exoneration
                of all Germans in the same vein as Adenauer. While Kohl did not
                name the perpetrators, it is clear they could not have been true
                Germans nor the men of the <em>Wehrmacht, </em>for they were victims.
                Just like Adenauer, Kohl attempted to change the terminology of the
                narrative, from perpetrator to victim, just as Adenauer changed
                <em>Wehrmacht</em> to <em>Nazi</em>. Kohl’s attempted message here is not surprising.
                The controversy it caused is far more significant, as touched upon below.

         <p>The main difference between Kohl&rsquo;s actions and Adenauer&rsquo;s was
           the reaction to them. Adenauer was the first chancellor of West Germany,
           while Kohl was the last (he would later lead a united Germany into the late 1990&rsquo;s).
           This change in time reflected an immense change in the perception of the myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo;
           <em>Wehrmacht </em>in West Germany. That Kohl met with any controversy for his statements at
           all is indicative of the willingness of a new generation of Germans to accept and attempt to
           learn from their grandparent&rsquo;s crimes, rather than try to forget the painful past.
           The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht </em>had become a changing political issue.
           No longer was it the main method for achieving a place for Germany in the post war new world
           order. Rather it became a controversy, and hopefully it will eventually become another painful
           memory in Germany&rsquo;s painful past. </p>
<p> While this examination has focused almost inclusively on the German effects of the myth of the
  &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em>, there is also the question of how the rest of the world
  interpreted the myth. Earlier, the initial American retelling of the war in <em>Life&rsquo;s Picture History</em>,
  can be seen as taking a supportive view of the myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em>. Interestingly,
  there remains to this day a clear memory of the myth in American popular culture. Take for example the HBO television
  series <em>Band of Brothers</em>. In a memorable scene of the show (embedded on the left), a captured
  <em>Wehrmacht </em>general gives a speech to his troops one last time before entering captivity at the
  hands of the show&rsquo;s central characters.&nbsp; At 1:19 into the video, he tells his troops that they &ldquo;
  have fought bravely and proudly for [their] country&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:34"> <a href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">34</a> </sup>. These are hardly the words one would expect if the
  show writers were aware of the terrible crimes of the <em>Wehrmacht</em>. The show&rsquo;s main characters express
  sympathy and identify with the <em>Wehrmacht </em>general&rsquo;s words. <em>Band of Brothers, </em>while a drama,
  was produced as a window into the lives and thoughts of ordinary soldiers. Thus the writers must believe that the
  ordinary American soldier at the time made a distinction between the honour of the Wehrmacht and the crimes of the
   Nazis. The myth has found it&rsquo;s way into the American popular consciousness. This popular consciousness may
   do more for Germany&rsquo;s international image then an entire generation of German Chancellor&rsquo;s speeches,
   for it speaks to the way that the actions of Germany&rsquo;s past are perceived outside of Germany. </p>
<p> It is perhaps in this that the lasting impact of the myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo;
  <em>Wehrmacht </em>can be seen most easily. The myth still pervades modern life, and
  has evolved past a political message. For some, the myth is another way to remember
  the <em>Third Reich</em>, as it gives a way to acknowledge the events of the past while
  providing a silver lining. The myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; <em>Wehrmacht</em> is
  escapism at it&rsquo;s core, an attempt to escape painful memories and move on to a
  hopefully more bright future. One would hope that this was the aim of Konrad Adenauer,
  Helmut Kohl and other members of the West German governments of the Cold War, that they
  had a true wish for reconciliation and remembrance. The alternative assumption is that
  Adenauer, Kohl and others wished to belittle the crimes of the Germans as the crimes of
   the few out of some malice and a wish to forget about the crimes of the past. This alternative
   is perhaps to much of a truth to bear, that history is being erased before it can even be properly
   told. In a world of &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; and far right populism, it is more important than ever
   to address the past as it actually happened, and to not attempt and appease sentiments or pre-existing
   beliefs in the telling of history.
